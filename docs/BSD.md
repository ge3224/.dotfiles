### What is the difference between Linux and BSD?

Linux and BSD are both Unix-like operating systems, but they have different lineages.

Unix was created in 1969 at AT&T's Bell Labs. Due to an earlier antitrust case, AT&T was forbidden from entering the computer business and was required to license the Unix's source code to anyone who asked for it. This led to a variety of academic and commercial variants.

Then, in 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs, and Unix could then be sold by Bell Labs as a proprietary product. Users were no longer legally allowed to modify Unix.

During the next few years, efforts were made by various developers to create a free Unix-like software system. Two of these initiatives were 386BSD, a descendant of the Berkley Software Distribution, and Linus Torvalds' Linux. Linux was released on Sept. 17, 1991. 386BSD predated Linux but was not released until 1992, due to legal complications. Torvalds has reportedly stated that if 386BSD had been available at the time, he probably would not have created Linux.
