#### Window Manager Config

I'm using [i3](https://i3wm.org/) because it was the first WM that I got running during my initial install.

[Cheat Sheet](https://i3wm.org/docs/refcard.html):

`$ mod` = windows key

- `$ mod <CR>` open a terminal.
- `$ mod <number>` go to workspace
- `$ mod shift <number>` move active window to specified workspace
- `$ mod shift q` close the active window
- `$ mod d` open application laucher (dmenu)

Basic config `$HOME/projects/archconf/i3/config`
