### Paru AUR helper

Paru is an AUR helper that automates tasks, such as searching for AUR packages, resolving dependencies, retrieving and building packages, retrieving web content and user comments, and submitting personal packages to the AUR.

- `$ cd [destination]`
- `$ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git`
- `$ cd ./paru`
- `$ makepkg -si`

After building you can use paru the same flags that you would use for pacman.
