## Overview

Arch Linux is a popular GNU/Linux distro. It is a minimum base system,
configured by the user to add only was is purposely required. Attractive
features include:

- You build your system yourself. You choose what components are installed, no
  bloat. There are no services running in the background that you are not aware
  of.
- Arch's package manager, [`pacman`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman),
  is easy to use and very well supported.
- Software availability is unrivaled. Besides the very extensive software
  options available through Arch's official repos, there is also the [Arch User
  Repository (AUR)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository).
- The [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) is an incredible resource.
- Rolling release means no upgrade from version to version. Although less
  stable than a static release model, the rolling release is ideal for a
  desktop workstation because it provides access to to the latest software
  releases.
